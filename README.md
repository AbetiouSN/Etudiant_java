# Etudiant_java
This project appears to be a Java-based training exercise focused on managing student information and their academic performance. While it may not be a complete or finalized project, it provides an opportunity to practice Java programming skills and learn about object-oriented programming concepts. The key components of this project include:

Main Class: The Main class serves as the entry point of the program. It initializes lists for students, subjects, and grades. Students are represented as objects of the Etudiant class, subjects as objects of the Matiere class, and grades as objects of the Note class.

Student Class (Etudiant): The Etudiant class is used to represent student information, including their name, identification numbers (CNE and CIN), age, and a list of their academic grades. It contains methods for adding grades, calculating the average, and displaying student information. It also includes a static counter to keep track of the number of students created.

Subject Class (Matiere): The Matiere class represents academic subjects, with fields for the subject name and code.

Grade Class (Note): The Note class is used to store individual student grades, associating a student with a subject and a numerical grade.

Data Population: The program populates data for students and subjects. Each student has grades in multiple subjects, and this data is used to calculate and display student averages.

Average Calculation and Sorting: The project calculates the average grade for each student, and it sorts the students based on their average grades in ascending order.

Displaying Information: The program displays student information, including name, identification, age, grades in various subjects, and their calculated average.

Overall, this project demonstrates fundamental concepts in Java, such as object-oriented programming, data structures (lists), class interactions, and sorting. It's a useful exercise for learning and practicing Java programming skills, although it may require further development for use in a real-world scenario or as part of a larger application.
